        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>In the spring of 2015, I was invited to an onsite interview and portfolio review. A few days before the visit, all applicants were told to respond to the following prompt:</p>  

        <div class="quote-container">
          <p id="quote">"Please redesign the Crossfit web site so that a person who works out irregularly can become informed about the CrossFit training program and find locations to join. The redesign does not need to cover the entire site, but it should include multiple pages, form factors, etc. as needed to demonstrate streamlined interaction, clean information architecture, and compelling visual design."
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>We were told to only spend a few hours on the project; just enough to represent our design process. Because time was so limited, I started the process by listing out what I hoped to accomplish:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Audit the current website</li>
          <li>Talk to potential users</li>
          <li>Design a new site map</li>
          <li>Create mobile wireframes</li>
          <li>Create desktop wireframes</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Step One: Auditing the Current Site</h2>


        <div class="col-lg-12" id="no-padding">
          <img src="../images/crossfitscreenshot.png">
        </div>

        <p>After visiting the Crossfit site for the first time, it was clear that it could benefit from a visual design overhaul, but I wanted to dive deeper into the structure of the site. The first red flag that caught my eye was the size of the main navigation menu. The current website does triple duty as a blog, an informational/marketing site and a hub for members. However, having 16 top-level menu items is excessive and complicated. Additionally, almost all of these pages were strangly located on individual subdomains, as shown by the site map below.</p>



        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <img src="../images/crossfit-old-sitemap.png">
        </div>



        <h2>Step Two: Talk to potential users</h2>
        <p>The most important step in understanding how to improve something is to understand the people who use it. In this case, I had to make sure that I spoke with people who could serve as archetypes for several types of Crossfitters. Because the clock was ticking, I didn't have time to recruit users or do an in-depth longitudinal study. I just called up a few of my friends and family members who I knew had varied Crossfit experience and asked them to describe what they were looking for.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4" id="users">
          <img src="../images/connor.png">
          <h3 id="centered">Connor</h3>
        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4"  id="users">
          <img src="../images/madi.png">
          <h3 id="centered">Madi</h3>

        </div>

        <div class="col-md-4"  id="users">
          <img src="../images/david.png">
          <h3 id="centered">David</h3>

        </div>

        <p>Each call was kept to around 5 minutes. I explained what I was doing and listened as they told me about their Crossfit experience. Connor had been considering going, but hadn't yet found a gym. Madi had gone several times, but does not go regularly to the same "box". David is a regular Crossfitter and hopes to participate in an upcoming age group competition.</p>
        <p>None of them had ever visited the Crossfit website, and only David said that the current site was helpful. He said his favorite feature was the workout of the day, but that it was difficult to find on the current site which put more emphasis on the blog.</p>
        <p>While David wasn't interested in discovering new gyms, both Connor and Madi thought this would be a helpful feature. When asked what was important to them in a particular crossfit gym, both indicated that pricing and quality were big differentiators.</p>
        <p>All participants surveyed claimed they used mobile devices for the majority of their browsing.</p>

        <h2>Step Three: Design a New Site Map</h2>

        <p>Before I turned my attention to the interaction design of the new site, I consolidated the sprawling architecture of the app into a more logical heirarchy. By cutting down the number of top-level pages, grouping similar pages into content clusters and proposing the removal or combination of multiple pages into one, I was able to create a sitemap that follows established patterns.</p>

        <p>With this new site map, almost all pages are on the main Crossfit.com domain instead of individual subdomains.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <img src="../images/crossfit-new-sitemap.png">
        </div>

        <h2>Step Four: Create Mobile Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Because all three of the users I spoke with used phones as their main browser, I decided to first focus on determining the mobile user flow for new members. This path assumes that experienced users such as David would log in to access an undesigned dashboard.</p>
        <p>When the user visits the homepage and hasn't logged in, he or she is presented with a large call to search for local gyms. These search results, sorted by default by geographic distance, can be filtered by gyms that offer programs at all levels of Crossfit experience. Because two of the interviewed users were price-sensitive, search results also contain featured promotions. Each gym is also assigned a community rating to help users find the best gym for them.</p>
        <p>After making a selection from the list, an individual gym detail page is displayed. The primary goal was to make it as easy as possible for users to call a gym or visit its website, with the secondary goal of displaying information and promotional materials.</p>
        <p>The final wireframe shows how the mobile menu would behave. This new navigation menu is based on the redesigned site map.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <img src="../images/crossfit-mobile-wireframe.png">          
        </div>

        <h2>Step Five: Create Desktop Wireframes</h2>
        <p>The final step in this exercise was to show how the mobile user flow would be experienced on a desktop browser. The content would be displayed in a responsive grid and resize dynamically to take advantage of the larger screen size. While the primary action on the mobile version of an individual gym detail page is a phone call button, this wouldn't make sense on a desktop. When these pages are accessed on a desktop browser, the phone call button is hidden.</p>

        <div class="col-lg-12">
          <img src="../images/crossfit-desktop-wireframe.png">
        </div>

        <div class="row">

          <div class="container">
            <div class="col-md-6" id="no-padding">
              <div id="previousproject">
                <p><em>Looking for the previous project?</em></p>
                <h2><a href="thesis.html">USC Media Arts Honors Thesis Project</a></h2>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6" id="no-padding">
             <div id="nextproject">
               <p><em>Looking for the next project?</em></p>
               <h2><a href="mini.html">MINI Cooper Research Project</a></h2>
             </div>
           </div>

         </div>
