        <h1>Crossfit Redesign Exercise</h1>

      <h2>The Project</h2>
      <p>In the spring of 2015, I was invited to interview onsite at IBM Design in Austin, Texas. A few days before the visit, all applicants were told to respond to a design exercise:</p>  
      <p></p> 

      <div class="quote-container">
        <p id="quote">"Please redesign the Crossfit web site so that a person who works out irregularly can become informed about the CrossFit training program and find locations to join. The redesign does not need to cover the entire site, but it should include multiple pages, form factors, etc. as needed to demonstrate streamlined interaction, clean information architecture, and compelling visual design."
        </p>
      </div>

      <p>We were told to only spend a few hours on the project; just enough to represent our design process. Because time was so limited, I started the process by listing out what I hoped to accomplish:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Talk to potential users</li>
        <li>Audit the current website</li>
        <li>Determine a new site map</li>
        <li>Create mobile wireframes that showcase the user flow for finding a gym</li>
        <li>Show the same user flow on desktop</li>

      </ol>

      <h2></h2>


      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>Auditing the Current Site</h2>
        <p>After visiting the Crossfit site for the first time, it was clear that it could benefit from a visual design overhaul, but I wanted to dive deeper into the structure of the site. The first red flag that caught my eye was the size of the main menu. The current website does triple duty as a blog, an informational/marketing site and a hub for members. However, having 16 top-level menu items is excessive and complicated. Additionally, almost all of these pages were strangly located on individual subdomains, as shown by the site map below.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-12">
        <img src="images/crossfit-old-sitemap.png">
      </div>

      <p>My first goal was to consolidate the sprawling architecture of the app into a more logical heirarchy. By cutting down the number of top level pages, grouping similar pages into content clusters and proposing the removal or combination of multiple pages into one, I was able to create a sitemap that follows established patterns.</p>
