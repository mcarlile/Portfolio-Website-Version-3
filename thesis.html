        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p class="marginBottomHalf">Now more than ever, people interested in quantifying life experiences have access to an unprecedented deluge of information about their own personal health, travel and communication patterns. Lifelogging projects in the connected age analyze and visualize these rich trails of data that are a byproduct of life online.</p>
        <p class="marginBottomHalf">Unlike most lifelogging projects, however, this installation interprets metadata extracted from a physical, non-digital artifact. 65401 is an interactive visualization of a small town in the Ozark mountains generated from the personal datebook my grandmother used when she worked as a real estate agent in the 1980s. Viewers use a tangible interface to generate a map of the town based off addresses, phone numbers and locations mentioned in this journal.</p>

              <h3>Data entry methods</h2>
                <p>Extracting the data to be visualized for my project was a time consuming endeavor. During this phase of the project, I discovered that optical character recognition software doesn't work with handwritten letters. Although I have access to journals from 1988, 1989 and 1990, I found that I would only have enough time to encode and visualize one of these years. My challenge was to encode 300 JPG scanned images of handwritten notes with scribbles, doodles and coffee stains into something that can be parsed by a computer.</p>

                <p>I turned to Amazon Mechanical Turk to try to minimize the hours I would spend hand copying her notes into a XML document. I funded my AMT account with $10 and created 43 Human Intelligence Tasks. I created an HTML template that would show the image I needed transcoded on the left side of the screen and fields to input text dates and entry values. Only 5 of 43 were submitted, however, so I had to try another strategy to finish the project.</p>

                  <p class="marginBottomHalf">Once the information was organized in a digital file, I was able to explore several data visualization strategies. Before I knew I wanted to focus on geographic information, I first created a test visualization that shows word count per entry in my grandmother's diary from January 1986. Each column represents one entry and each dot in that row represents a word.</p>
                  <p>I went about making this visualization to figure out how I should structure my data within a JSON file so it can be parsed and visualized procedurally. Since the project involves so much hand transcribing of information, I needed to make sure that I wanted to use the D3.js library to do the heavy lifting for me in generating visualizations.</p>

                    <p class="marginBottomHalf">The visualization above looked at the frequency of times my grandmother mentioned a location in her journal, but it didn't give any sense of what that location looked like. For my second prototype, I wanted to viscerally connect the audience to the real locations my grandmother mentioned in her diary. For each address or street mentioned, I entered the location into Google Maps street view, zoomed out as far as I could and took a screenshot. After compiling all of these ../images, I used Adobe Photoshop's Batch Processing function to crop out all interface elements, resize the image to a manageable size and apply a black and white filter.</p>
                    <p>Next, I created a processing sketch that lets viewers interact with a timeline from January 1 - March 31, 1988. If my grandmother visited a location on the selected date, an image from Google Maps street view is shown. If she visited multiple locations, photos of each location are layered in the same window.</p>

                      <p class="marginBottomHalf">A third prototype during the exploration period of this project involved designing a system that compared the geographic metadata of individual entries to the textual information contained within each entry. To accomplish this, I created a new processing sketch with two modes. After a user selects an entry date, they can toggle between the non-redacted version of the date in question or the version redacted to just geographic information.</p>
                      <p>This prototype showed that many of the entries from my grandmother's diary do not reference specific locations. This discovery informed my decision to visualize location data in weeks and months, not days.</p>

After getting a CSV with each date and phone number, I used Whitepages' Pro Graph API to map the phone numbers to specific addresses if possible and to zip codes if necessary. In the MapBox visualization, lines with lower opacity represent calls made only one time, while lines with higher opacity represent calls made multiple times.</p>

To reflect the fact that the information being visualized was originally stored in a physical artifact, I wanted my interface to be uniquely tactile.
