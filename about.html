    <div class="row">
      <div class="six columns">
        <p class="marginBottomHalf">Hello! I'm a product designer at IBM working on building enterprise software that people enjoy using. My process centers around listening, understanding, tinkering and prototyping. Nothing makes me happier than working with others to use design thinking and user research to create great digital experiences. 
          <p class="marginBottomHalf">While interning at Amazon and Disney Interactive, I fell in love with the product design process. I graduated from the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts' Interactive Media Division in 2015. There, I studied storytelling, interactive design and data visualization. At the USC Mobile and Environmental Media Lab I assisted with several research projects relating to the Internet of Things.
            <p class="marginBottomDouble">Outside of work, I love to backpack through the National Park system and contribute to trail restoration projects on public land. Other interests include running long distances very slowly, eating at Waffle House, playing sad country songs and watching too many movies</p>

            <p class="italic marginBottomHalf">He's taken one of the biggest and most complex areas of the release, gained understanding of the customer process, pain points and priorities and synthesized them into a great user experience. He's been very good at taking the discussion and feedback during meetings and quickly incorporating them into the design in a way that moves the user experience forward as opposed to creating churn and extra followup. He keeps meetings on track and prioritizes topics so we get good use of everyone's time. He has a positive attitude and is a pleasure to work with.</p>

            <h3>Design Thinking</h3>
            <p class="marginBottomHalf">When I first came to IBM, I had the pleasure of joining 70 designers fresh out of college in an intensive 3-month “design bootcamp”. During this experience, we learned how to apply design thinking and design research methodologies to solving enterprise-level problems at speed
              and scale.</p>
              <p class="marginBottomHalf">While bootcamp was mostly a learning experience, we also used design thinking to deliver real outcomes that solved real business problems. My team’s research and design work helped lay the foundation for IBM Watson Education and helped improve the IBM Customer Experience Analytics onboarding process.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="six columns">
              <h3>Workshop Facilitation</h3>
              <p class="marginBottomHalf">Now that I’ve been deployed to a product team, I’ve set a personal goal for myself to learn more about how to facilitate design thinking workshops. Helping to create a culture that values design in a company as big and as old as IBM is no easy task. But it’s my goal to help everyone on my team, not just designers, to focus on solving real human problems and to keep our users as our North Star.</p>
              <p class="marginBottomHalf">To work towards this goal, I have taken formal facilitation training courses at IBM. This summer, I helped support facilitate a week-long introduction to design thinking workshop for industry professionals within IBM. </p>
