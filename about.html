        <h2>Hello! I'm McKenzie, a product designer working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, human-centered design, big data, and cloud computing. </h2>
        <p class="marginBottomHalf">What I love most about design is the process of observing how people use complicated systems, finding pain points and working with talented people to create beautiful and simple solutions.</p>
        <p class="marginBottomHalf">My primary focus is interaction and UX design, but as a proud generalist, I find joy in communicating ideas clearly at any level. On any given day, I can be found working on a wide range of design artifacts, including research presentations, hand-drawn sketches, information architecture diagrams, pixel-perfect UI comps or coded interactive prototypes that demonstrate micorinteractions and animation.</p>
        <p class="marginBottomDouble">Outside of work, I love to backpack through the National Park system and contribute to trail restoration projects on public land. Other interests include running long distances very slowly, eating at Waffle House, playing sad country songs and watching too many movies</p>

     <p class="italic marginBottomHalf">He's taken one of the biggest and most complex areas of the release, gained understanding of the customer process, pain points and priorities and synthesized them into a great user experience. He's been very good at taking the discussion and feedback during meetings and quickly incorporating them into the design in a way that moves the user experience forward as opposed to creating churn and extra followup. He keeps meetings on track and prioritizes topics so we get good use of everyone's time. He has a positive attitude and is a pleasure to work with.</p>
